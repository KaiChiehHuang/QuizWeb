Git flow for creating a new branch and merging that branch into master:

* git checkout master  
* git pull origin master  
* git checkout -b your-initials-[something-descriptive]  
* git push origin your-intiials-[something-descriptive]  
* // [make some changes to your new branch]  
* git add --a  
* git commit -m "Descriptive message"  
* git checkout master  
* git pull origin master  
* git merge your-initials-[something-descriptive]  
* // [fix any conflicts]  
* git push origin master  
* // then you can delete your local version of the branch   
* git branch -d your-initials-[something-descriptive]  
* // then, if you're absolutely sure that the work you did in your branch was merged  
* // delete the remote branch  
* git push origin --delete your-initials-[something-descriptive] 


Git flow for keeping your own branch up to date with master
* git pull origin master
* git checkout your-branch
* git merge origin/master 
* // fix merge conflicts if necessary and continue working
